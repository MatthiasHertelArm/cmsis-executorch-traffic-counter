# Where the ExecuTorch CMSIS pack comes from

The `PyTorch::ExecuTorch` pack is installed into your CMSIS pack root like
any other pack; nothing of it lives in this repository. This page explains
where it comes from, how to build one yourself, and how to move to a newer
ExecuTorch version.

## Where it comes from

The pack is published as an asset of the matching ExecuTorch GitHub release,
which is also what its `.pdsc` declares as its download location:

```xml
<url>https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/releases/download/v1.5.1/</url>
```

So the normal acquisition routes work, and `cbuild setup ... --packs` takes
care of it on a fresh clone. To install it by hand:

```bash
cpackget add PyTorch::ExecuTorch@1.5.1
```

The version is pinned exactly, in `cmsis-executorch.csolution.yml` and
`cmsis-executorch.cproject.yml`:

```yaml
packs:
  - pack: PyTorch::ExecuTorch@1.5.1
```

Both must agree. The pin is exact rather than a `@^1.5.1` range because the
pack's C++ runtime and the Python exporter have to be the *same* ExecuTorch
version — see [Moving to a new ExecuTorch version](#moving-to-a-new-executorch-version).

`create_ai_layer.py` reads the installed pack's `.pdsc` out of the pack root
(`$CMSIS_PACK_ROOT`, or cpackget's default) to find out which operator
components exist. It reads the version `cbuild setup` resolved, taken from
`cmsis-executorch.cbuild-pack.yml`, so a pack root holding several
ExecuTorch versions cannot make it read the wrong one.

## What is in the pack

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `PyTorch.ExecuTorch.pdsc` | Component declarations — one component per operator, plus runtime and backend |
| `src/` | ExecuTorch runtime, kernel and Ethos-U backend sources |
| `include/` | Public headers, **including the bundled `include/flatbuffers/`** |
| `armclang_shims/` | Small compatibility shims for Arm Compiler 6 |
| `Documentation/` | Pack README |
| `LICENSE` | Upstream BSD-3-Clause (the example code around it is Apache-2.0) |

It is a **source** pack: nothing is prebuilt. Every operator is a selectable
component, which is what lets `create_ai_layer.py` narrow the link to
exactly the kernels a given `.pte` needs.

## Building a pack yourself

Worth knowing if you need a version that has no published pack yet, or want to
carry a local ExecuTorch change into the firmware. The generator lives in the
ExecuTorch tree at `backends/arm/cmsis_pack/scripts/build_pack.sh`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/executorch.git
cd executorch
git checkout release/1.5          # or the tag matching your target version
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

> **Run the CMake cross-compile before `build_pack.sh`.**
>
> This is the one trap worth knowing about. If `build_pack.sh` runs without the
> prior cross-compile, it completes successfully but **silently omits**:
>
> - the bundled `include/flatbuffers/` headers, and
> - the flatc-generated `program_generated.h` and `scalar_type_generated.h`.
>
> The resulting pack looks complete and fails at compile time with missing-header
> errors that point nowhere useful. Those two headers are generated with:
>
> ```bash
> flatc --cpp --cpp-std c++11 --gen-mutable --scoped-enums <schema>.fbs
> ```
>
> `flatc` ships inside the executorch wheel — after `./setup_venv.sh` it is at
> `.venv/bin/flatc`.

Then run the generator; the pack lands in `pack-output/`:

```bash
backends/arm/cmsis_pack/scripts/build_pack.sh
```

### Verifying a pack you built

Before trusting a freshly built pack, check the parts that go missing quietly:

```bash
PACK=pack-output/PyTorch.ExecuTorch.<version>

# 1. The bundled flatbuffers headers must be present.
test -d "$PACK/include/flatbuffers" || echo "MISSING: include/flatbuffers"

# 2. The flatc-generated headers must be present.
for h in program_generated.h scalar_type_generated.h; do
    find "$PACK/include" -name "$h" | grep -q . || echo "MISSING: $h"
done

# 3. The component list should still cover the operators the model uses.
grep -c '<component' "$PACK/PyTorch.ExecuTorch.pdsc"
```

A pack that passes all three is safe to install:

```bash
cpackget add pack-output/PyTorch.ExecuTorch.<version>.pack
```

## Moving to a new ExecuTorch version

The pack's C++ runtime and the Python exporter must come from the *same*
ExecuTorch version — a `.pte` produced by a different version than the runtime
that loads it will fail at load time, or worse, at inference time. Four steps,
in order:

1. **Install the new pack** — `cpackget add PyTorch::ExecuTorch@<new>`, or
   build one yourself (above) if the version is not published.
2. **Update both pins** — `PyTorch::ExecuTorch@<new>` in the csolution and in
   the cproject.
3. **Update the Python pins**: `executorch`, `torch` and `torchao` in
   `requirements.txt`, following the new release's `install_requirements.py`;
   `requirements-arm-tosa.txt` (the TOSA serializer and its flatbuffers pin)
   only changes when the Arm backend's `requirements-arm-tosa.txt` does.
4. **Rebuild the venv, the AI layer and the project:**

   ```bash
   ./setup_venv.sh --recreate
   cbuild setup cmsis-executorch.csolution.yml --active AppKit-E7 --packs
   python3 create_ai_layer.py cmsis-executorch.cbuild-mlops.yml
   cbuild cmsis-executorch.csolution.yml --active AppKit-E7
   cbuild cmsis-executorch.csolution.yml --active SSE-300-U55
   ```

   A changed operator set simply shows up in the regenerated
   `ai_layer/ai_layer.clayer.yml`.

Finally, update the version wherever it appears in prose: the README
(Prerequisites and the pack-version note), the csolution header comment and
this page.
